A python based basic password manager that makes it so the user can only see the saved passwords using the program by encrypting the file that has the data in them so the passwords cannot be seen by just opening the file.

INSTRUCTIONS:

- INSTALL "cryptio" and "fernet" from pip
- RUN THE CONFIG FILE AND SET YOUR ADMIN PASSWORD
- Do not delete anything from the files
